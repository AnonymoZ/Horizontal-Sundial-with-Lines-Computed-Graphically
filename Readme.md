# Horizontal Sundial with Lines Computed Graphically

Misse told us to build a Sundial for *Introduction to Astrophysics*, with no prior instruction. Here's how we did it!

Keep in mind these facts:
1. You need to design your Sundial according to your _Latitude_. Therefore, you can't copy and paste mine!
2. Your Gnomon (the _triangle_!) needs to be constructed with _special_ angles. More on that later.
3. Your Sundial can also indicate the _day of the year_ (heck!). For that we need to include curves called _Analemma_.

Here's the finished product. There's more in our pdf (link)!
